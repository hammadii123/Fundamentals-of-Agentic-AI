# Temperature in Prompt Engineering 

## 1. What is Temperature?

Think of temperature as a **creativity level of AI**.
It decides how the AI picks words when it answers you.

* **Low temperature (close to 0)** → AI gives safe, predictable answers.
* **High temperature (closer to 1 or more)** → AI gives creative, surprising answers.

---

## 2. Simple Analogy (Daily Life)

Imagine you are choosing food at a restaurant:

* **T = 0.0** → You always order the same dish (safe).
* **T = 0.3** → You mostly order your favorite dish but sometimes try another.
* **T = 0.7** → You try different dishes every time.
* **T = 1.2** → You may even order something totally unexpected or weird!

So, temperature = how adventurous you are.

---

## 3. How Does It Work Inside the AI?

AI doesn’t “know the answer directly.” It looks at a list of possible next words with probabilities.

Example: You type → "The cat sat on the..."

* mat → 60% chance

* floor → 20% chance

* chair → 10% chance

* moon → 10% chance

* **If T = 0.1 (low):** AI almost always picks “mat.”

* **If T = 1.0 (normal):** AI might pick mat, floor, or chair.

* **If T = 2.0 (high):** Even “moon” could be chosen!

So, temperature changes how strict or free AI is when choosing.

## 4. Real Market Examples with Agentic AI

### Example 1: Coding Assistant (GitHub Copilot / Cursor / Replit)

**Code:**

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature=0.2,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a coding assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function to reverse a string."}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Response (Low T = 0.2, Safe & Predictable):**

```python
def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
    return s[::-1]
```

**If we set temperature=1.0 (Creative):**

```python
def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:
    # Using recursion for fun
    if len(s) == 0:
        return s
    else:
        return reverse_string(s[1:]) + s[0]
```

**Market Relevance:**

* GitHub Copilot → keeps T low for correctness.
* Replit Ghostwriter → may use higher T for creative alternatives.

---

### Example 2: Customer Support Bot (Banks vs E-commerce)

* **Low Temperature (T=0.3):**
  User: “What’s my account balance?”
  AI: “Your current account balance is \$1,250.43.”

* **Medium Temperature (T=0.6):**
  AI: “Your account balance is \$1,250.43. Do you want me to also show your last 3 transactions?”

* **High Temperature (T=1.0):**
  AI: “Looks like your balance is \$1,250.43. Want me to share a cool saving tip too?”

**Market Examples:**

* Banks (JPMorgan, Citibank AI bots) → use low T.
* E-commerce (Amazon, Shopify stores) → use medium T.

---

### Example 3: Marketing & Ad Copy (Coca-Cola, Nike, Shopify)

**Code:**

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    temperature=1.0,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a creative ad writer."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a catchy slogan for a sports drink."}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Response (High T = 1.0, Creative):**
“Fuel your hustle. Refresh your power.”

**Response (Low T = 0.2, Boring but Safe):**
“A sports drink to keep you hydrated during exercise.”

**Market Relevance:**

* Coca-Cola AI marketing labs → use high T.
* Shopify merchants → often use high T for unique product descriptions.

---

### Example 4: News Summarization (Notion AI vs Buzzfeed)

**Input:** “Summarize today’s stock market news.”

* **Low T (0.2):**
  “Stock markets closed higher today. The S\&P 500 gained 1.2%, led by tech stocks. Investors reacted positively to the Fed’s comments on interest rates.”

* **High T (1.0):**
  “Wall Street roared back today. Tech giants fueled a rally as investors cheered the Fed’s softer stance on rates.”

**Market Relevance:**

* Notion AI, Perplexity → low T for factual summaries.
* Buzzfeed, Tabloid news AI → high T for catchy headlines.

---

### Example 5: Gaming & Storytelling Agents (AI Dungeon, Role-Playing Games)

**User Prompt:** “The knight enters a dark forest. What happens next?”

* **Low T (0.3):**
  “The knight walks carefully through the forest. He hears the sound of birds and the rustling of leaves.”

* **High T (1.2):**
  “The knight steps into the shadowy forest, only to be greeted by glowing eyes in the trees. A talking wolf whispers: ‘You are not welcome here…’”

**Market Example:**
AI Dungeon uses high T to keep the story unpredictable.

## 5. Agentic AI Context (Why Temperature Matters)

In **Agentic AI** (AI agents that plan, use tools, and make decisions):

* **Low T Agents:** For structured tasks (coding, SQL, finance, healthcare).
* **Medium T Agents:** For teaching, onboarding, tutoring.
* **High T Agents:** For entertainment, marketing, creative ideation.

---

## 6. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Low Temperature:** Safe, repeatable answers. Great for coding, math, legal writing.
* **High Temperature:** Creative, fun, diverse answers. Good for stories, brainstorming, marketing.

**Cons**

* **Low Temperature:** Boring, robotic, repetitive.
* **High Temperature:** Risky → AI may give nonsense or hallucinate. Not good for serious tasks (finance/medicine).

## 7. Best Practices (Industry Usage)

| Task                  | Best Temperature | Why                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Coding / SQL / Math   | 0.0 – 0.3        | Needs correctness            |
| Customer Support      | 0.3 – 0.6        | Safe but still human-like    |
| Brainstorming Ideas   | 0.5 – 0.8        | Mix of logic + creativity    |
| Storytelling / Poetry | 0.8 – 1.2        | Needs variety & creativity   |
| Games / Jokes / Fun   | 1.0 – 1.5        | Unpredictable & entertaining |

## 8. Easy Daily Analogy (Spice Level in Food)

* **0.0 = No spice at all** → very plain food (safe but boring).
* **0.5 = Medium spice** → balanced (tasty and safe).
* **1.0 = Extra spicy** → fun but can burn your mouth!
* **2.0 = Over spicy** → chaos, too much to handle.

Temperature works exactly like spice.

---

## 9. Final Summary

* Temperature = AI’s **creativity knob**.
* **Low T** = safe, reliable but boring.
* **High T** = creative, risky but fun.
* Choose temperature **based on your task**.

43. At T>1, all tokens become less distinct.
    **True (Higher T flattens probability gaps, reducing distinction.)**

44. Temperature can fix bias in dataset.
    **False (Bias comes from training data, not decoding strategy.)**
